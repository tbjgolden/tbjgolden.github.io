<!-- post-title: The dangers of a free, open and accessible universal education platform -->

<p>Education is hugely misunderstood.</p>
<p>Its purpose is not to liberate. Its purpose is conformity, and
compliance.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not exclusively a bad thing. But plenty of times in history, and
recent history, it has been. I am frequently shocked by quick some
people are to accept tribalism as a necessary evil.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t believe it is. There is nothing necessary about chemical weapons
in Syria; never mind that they were, to all accounts, used by the Syrian
government.</p>
<p>The root cause of tribalism is knowing that there are tribes. A
government run education platform&#39;s purpose is to serve the government.
That means to develop the people as resources, minimise the risk of
being overthrown and encourage support for the government&#39;s tribe. That
tribe is the country you are born into, or the political party, or the
government ideology.</p>
<p>Education is the cause of tribalism. But it is also the means to stop
it.</p>
<h1 id="future-education-model">Future education model</h1>
<p>In the near future, I will look to develop an open learning experience
for children, that can be played on a mobile phone. Others exist, but
are more concerned with examinable education rather than a complete
education.</p>
<p>A few values that it might encourage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encouraging scientific method over speculation</li>
<li>A basis in logic, and fallacy</li>
<li>Looking at problems in a global sense</li>
</ul>
<p>A few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>For yes or no questions, asking them to quantify how sure they are</li>
<li>a single currency (fictional currency ?)</li>
<li>a single language (fictional language ?)</li>
<li>What does it mean to be human? What is society?</li>
<li>Teaching the principle of information</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Cognitive bias</li>
<li>Constructed, gradual learning frameworks (like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMIX">MMIX</a>)</li>
</ul>
