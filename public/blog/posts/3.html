<!-- post-title: My complaint to the BBC -->
<!-- post-timestamp: 1539424980866 -->

<p>This is less an article, rather a documenting of the first, and probably
last, complaint I will ever write to the BBC.</p>
<p>The article they posted that caused me to write a complaint was this
one:</p>
<p><strong>Bodyguard &#39;airbrushing reality&#39; with powerful women portrayal</strong><br><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45803343">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45803343</a></p>
<p>When I moved to the US, I discovered a media that was entirely dependent
on viewer numbers. As a result TV, radio, newspapers and even YouTube
(the recommended algorithm uses your location) to have divisory
narratives.</p>
<p>A result of this has been inflated or even manufactured news stories and
topics. For a long time, the BBC has insulated itself from this by being
publicly funded. They don&#39;t have the same incentive to follow this path.</p>
<p>The BBC has to appear neutral. It also has to be relevant. There is more
media noise than ever before, and there may be a desire to work in their
own &quot;clickbait&quot; media. But it is their public status that makes their
purpose as the perceived eye of the storm.</p>
<p>They should not abandon or abuse this purpose.</p>
<p>Even given that conflict of purpose that the BBC is under, it published
that article. An article that is divisive and yet, not about being
neutral or relevant. It has no value.</p>
<p>It&#39;s narrative suggests that its subject is controversial, but it isn&#39;t.</p>
<p>I support equality, but you won&#39;t typically see me fighting tooth and
nail for first world women&#39;s rights, especially as men&#39;s rights are in
my opinion, not given full credibility. But this case is clear cut:</p>
<ol>
<li>In most other shows, there are more male roles than female roles as
actors.</li>
<li>There are more female actors than male actors, which makes it harder
for female actors to find roles.</li>
<li>There is no real need to have more male roles than female roles in
contemporary dramas.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;d also suggest (without proof) that the available female actors are
likely better qualified than the available male actors. We probably
should be encouraging writers of contemporary dramas to have more female
roles. At the very least, we shouldn&#39;t be undermining the writers who
do.</p>
<p>The BBC is manufacturing an empty, useless debate. When there aren&#39;t any
stories, you shouldn&#39;t publish any.</p>
<h1 id="the-letter">The Letter</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If I&#39;m a male actor, I&#39;m annoyed at the repeated emphasis on this
topic.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m a female actor, I&#39;m annoyed as in a field where there are more
male roles than female roles and more female actors than male actors,
my chances aren&#39;t being helped.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m a woman, I&#39;m seeing our attempt at equality be pushed back in a
field where it quite obviously is unfair.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m a man, I&#39;m confused as to why I&#39;m asked to support affirmative
action towards improving women&#39;s career opportunities then watch it be
undermined.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m a cynic, I might imagine the BBC just wants to draw attention
to its own series through the medium of biased journalism on a
non-story.</p>
<p>I could go on for quite a while with this &quot;If I&#39;m X&quot; stuff, which
makes me wonder... who is this article for? The only person who might
find this article interesting is a young girl who probably doesn&#39;t
need reminding or even to know in the first place that the odds
haven&#39;t always been with them. It has been long suggested on the BBC
and other media that making people aware that they&#39;re not supposed to
succeed at something doesn&#39;t, on mass, help them.</p>
