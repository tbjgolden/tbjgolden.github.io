<ol>
<li>Smartphones to everyone</li>
<li>Free, open, decentralised universal education platform run on
smartphones</li>
<li>Random mutations in platform powered by deep learning</li>
<li>A few generations of computer-taught humans (new-age discrimination
based on learning mutations)</li>
<li>Platform can measure things like human reason, by learning from
human data</li>
<li>Computers show in simulations that they&#39;re better than humans at
&#39;human reason&#39;</li>
<li>Human-computer feedback loop takes complete control?</li>
</ol>
<p>Potential risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isaac Asimov-esque unexpected runtime results</li>
<li>Corporations exploit universal education platform</li>
<li>Moral ambiguities and paradoxes</li>
<li>Quanitifying and validating abstract concepts (like love and art)</li>
</ul>
<p>Points of personal interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>The process of migrating the delegation of moral choices to
computers</li>
<li>Methods and effects of delimiting deep learning outcomes without
funneling results</li>
<li>Methods and effects of delimiting the frequency of mutations within
the deep learning algorithm, per the previous point</li>
<li>Where are the resources on this kind of topic?</li>
</ul>
