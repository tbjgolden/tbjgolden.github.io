<p>(Open publication of my formal complaint to BBC News)</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>the BBC published a pointless article designed to trigger</li>
  <li>got triggered</li>
  <li>wrote triggered message designed to trigger</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>The article they posted that caused me to write a complaint was this one:</p>

    If I&#39;m a male actor, I&#39;m annoyed at the repeated emphasis on this
    topic.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I&#39;m a female actor, I&#39;m annoyed as in a field where there are
    more male roles than female roles and more female actors than male actors,
    my chances aren&#39;t being helped.

  <p>
    If I&#39;m a woman, I&#39;m seeing our attempt at equality be pushed back in
    a field where it quite obviously is unfair.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I&#39;m a man, I&#39;m confused as to why I&#39;m asked to support
    affirmative action towards improving women&#39;s career opportunities then
    watch it be undermined.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I&#39;m a cynic, I might imagine the BBC just wants to draw attention to
    its own series through the medium of biased journalism on a non-story.
  </p>
  <p>
    I could go on for quite a while with this &quot;If I&#39;m X&quot; stuff,
    which makes me wonder... who is this article for? The only person who might
    find this article interesting is a young girl who probably doesn&#39;t need
    reminding or even to know in the first place that the odds haven&#39;t
    always been with them. It has been long suggested on the BBC and other media
    that making people aware that they&#39;re not supposed to succeed at
    something doesn&#39;t, on mass, help them.
