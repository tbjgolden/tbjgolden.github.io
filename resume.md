Who am I?

Tom universal traits

I am willing to work as hard, or harder than others

I intentionally gravitate towards indifference
I am analytical
I chase Pareto optimality
I never act with aggression unless confronted with malice or gross negligence
I try to be efficient

I seek to be a positive role model

Who am I most likely to be a good role model for?
How would I perform best as a role model?
How would I aim to be a role model for my children?
What character traits suit both me and being this type of role model?
