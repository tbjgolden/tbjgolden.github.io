**The World Wide Web is designed to be as accessible.** Using the right
HTML tags and attributes will result in a website that is by-and-large
friendly to those who do not have the required coordination to use a
pointing device (like a mouse or trackpad), as well as usable by those
with visual impairment.

It's only when we try to make things pretty rather than functional that
we start to make things harder for these users.

Of course, most websites are more interested in the
80-90%<sup>[\[1\]](https://bthechange.com/how-many-people-with-disabilities-use-my-website-2e737caf55bf)</sup>
of visitors that do not have disabilities. As such, appearance typically
takes a higher priority.

**This article is not to discourage people from serving the majority.
This article is to show a few ways to improve the appearance of your
website, while facilitating those with impairments with minimum
effort.**

Large companies have [a
lot](https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/web-accessibility-lawsuits/)
riding on providing an accessible service, and those ought to put more
thought into it than these solutions offer. This article is for everyone
else.

## `:focus`

You know, this thing:

**Chrome:**  
![](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/14369/focus-highlight-chrome.png)

**Firefox:**  
![](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/14371/focus-highlight-chrome.png)

When you navigate a page using the keyboard, with \[TAB\], \[ENTER\],
\[SPACE\] and the arrow keys, these glows appear from the currently
focused element, so the user can see "where they are", so to speak.

I've worked with plenty of people writing websites who don't know why
they're there. And I've worked with plenty more who use the keyboard to
browse websites all the time, as it's often faster.

The former group always say the same thing. What is that blue border?
How do we get rid of it?

**DO NOT GET RID OF THE GLOW** ...unless you're replacing it with
something else.

And replacing it with something else is no mean feat.

Here's a naive effort:

```css
:focus {
  outline: 0; /* <- disable glow */
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

> <span>Unfocused</span> →
> <span style="outline: 0; background-color: yellow">Focused</span>

The default browser styles give the element in question an outline,
which works well as it is a relatively uncommon selector which is
visible for both block and inline elements.

But for more arty projects or design centric companies, these are
considered unattractive. And as the vast majority of users don't realise
that these outlines have an actual purpose, they will think it's just
ugly design.

So the aim is to come up with an alternative that is arguably less ugly,
has some element of context to the element it is referring to, and won't
clash with other styles. After all, it ought to be easily visible, as
that is it's purpose.

(For the record, this article by David Gilbertson gives a JS way of
ensuring styles are only visible if you're actually using tabs for
navigation:

# Previous attempts

Whenever you change the default `:focus` styles, you may run into
problems of another selector with a higher specificity overriding the
styles. For instance, if your focused element already has a box shadow
from class or id selector styles, then the focus may not appear at all,
which would be a big accessibility and usability no-no.

Putting `!important` on the `:focus` property values may fix the issue
but will probably end up causing others.

## Default styles

```css
/* no style declaration */
```

> <span>Unfocused</span> → <span id="example-a">Focused</span>

## Browser normalised `outline`

Most reliable and consistent, but arguably most ugly.

```css
:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #3a99fc;
}
```

> <span>Unfocused</span> → <span id="example-b">Focused</span>

## Browser normalised `box-shadow`

As ugly as the chrome focus, but consistent cross-browser. Can run into
problems with focused elements that already have a `box-shadow`.

```css
:focus {
  outline: 0;
  box-shadow: 0 0 4px #3a99fc, 0 0 4px #3a99fc, 0 0 4px #3a99fc inset;
}
```

> <span>Unfocused</span> → <span id="example-c">Focused</span>

## Use a `background-color`

When used with block elements, this can look quite good. But many
focusable elements already have a `background`, which means some TLC is
required, and it is probably not worth it for the end result.

```css
:focus {
  outline: 0;
  background-color: rgba(58, 153, 252, .3);
}
```

> <span>Unfocused</span> → <span id="example-d">Focused</span>

## Opaque `background-color` with 4 `box-shadow`s (highlighter style)

Similar issues as previous, except (1) it looks better, (2) it will at
the very least be visible in the majority of cases where either a
`background` or a `box-shadow` is not already given to the element, and
(3) it might be difficult to find an opaque colour that pairs with every
possible adjacent colour.

```css
:focus {
  outline: 0;
  box-shadow:
    -3px -3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253),
    -3px  3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253),
     3px -3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253),
     3px  3px 0 rgba(158, 203, 253);
}
```

> <span>Unfocused</span> → <span id="example-e">Focused</span>

## Translucent pseudo-element overlay

Avoids most of the clashes, and looks great with block elements. Whereas
changing the background color of an element might cause non transparent
images inside to look awkward, this will overlay them.

Definitely my favourite appearance-wise, and the Google Play Music app
which is very tab-key friendly uses it for the play button, next-song
button and so on.

Key issues:

  - Reduces contrast, potentially making it a problem for the visually
    impaired.
  - Clashes with anything with the same (before/after) pseudo element.
  - Does not work for any tags that cannot contain pseudo elements,
    which is a lot of them, including many form inputs, and img tags.
  - Adding `position: relative` to an element can have some wild side
    effects.

```css
:focus {
  position: relative;
  outline: 0;
}

:focus::before {
  content: '';
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 9999;
  pointer-events: none;
  top: -3px;
  left: -3px;
  right: -3px;
  bottom: -3px;
  background-color: rgba(158, 203, 253, .4);
}
```

> <span>Unfocused</span> → <span id="example-f">Focused</span>

# My current (low-effort) method - `filter: drop-shadow`

```css
:focus {
  outline: 0;
  -webkit-filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0.2ex);
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 0.2ex);
}
```

> <span class="text-a"><span>Unfocused</span> →
> <span id="example-g">Focused</span></span>

It's a shadow. It looks a bit strange, but:

  - It works with block and inline elements, as well as wrapping text
  - The drop shadow has context of the element (the colour of the shadow
    is the element's `color` and the size of the shadow is relative to
    the element's `font-size`)
  - It rarely clashes with anything as filters are so rarely used on
    focusable elements.
  - It looks at transparency and border radii to generate the shadow.
  - You can customise how the shadow looks on block elements by changing
    the block element's `color` and `font-size`, which does not affect
    the block element's appearance itself, and the effects on the
    descendants can be overridden by the children.

## Examples

### Effect relative to font-size

> <span class="text-a">Unfocused →
> </span><span id="example-g" class="text-a">Focused</span>  
> <span class="text-b">Unfocused →
> </span><span id="example-g" class="text-b">Focused</span>  
> <span class="text-c">Unfocused →
> </span><span id="example-g" class="text-c">Focused</span>

### Effect shares font color

> <span class="text-d">Unfocused →
> </span><span id="example-g" class="text-d">Focused</span>  
> <span class="text-e">Unfocused →
> </span><span id="example-g" class="text-e">Focused</span>  
> <span class="text-f">Unfocused →
> </span><span id="example-g" class="text-f">Focused</span>

### Background and transparency friendly

> <div class="button-a">
> 
> Unfocused
> 
> </div>
> 
> →
> 
> <div id="example-g" class="button-a">
> 
> Focused
> 
> </div>
> 
>   
>   
> 
> <div class="button-b">
> 
> </div>
> 
> →
> 
> <div id="example-g" class="button-b">
> 
> </div>

A more resilient version of the solution would be to test for filter
support and then use the native browser as a fallback, and have vendor
prefixes.
