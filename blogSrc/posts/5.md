1.  Smartphones to everyone
2.  Free, open, decentralised universal education platform run on
    smartphones
3.  Random mutations in platform powered by deep learning
4.  A few generations of computer-taught humans (new-age discrimination
    based on learning mutations)
5.  Platform can measure things like human reason, by learning from
    human data
6.  Computers show in simulations that they're better than humans at
    'human reason'
7.  Human-computer feedback loop takes complete control?

Potential risks:

  - Isaac Asimov-esque unexpected runtime results
  - Corporations exploit universal education platform
  - Moral ambiguities and paradoxes
  - Quanitifying and validating abstract concepts (like love and art)

Points of personal interest:

  - The process of migrating the delegation of moral choices to
    computers
  - Methods and effects of delimiting deep learning outcomes without
    funneling results
  - Methods and effects of delimiting the frequency of mutations within
    the deep learning algorithm, per the previous point
  - Where are the resources on this kind of topic?
