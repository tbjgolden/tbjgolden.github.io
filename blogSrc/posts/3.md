<!-- post-title: My complaint to the BBC -->

This is less an article, rather a documenting of the first, and probably
last, complaint I will ever write to the BBC.

The article they posted that caused me to write a complaint was this
one:

**Bodyguard 'airbrushing reality' with powerful women portrayal**  
<https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45803343>

When I moved to the US, I discovered a media that was entirely dependent
on viewer numbers. As a result TV, radio, newspapers and even YouTube
(the recommended algorithm uses your location) to have divisory
narratives.

A result of this has been inflated or even manufactured news stories and
topics. For a long time, the BBC has insulated itself from this by being
publicly funded. They don't have the same incentive to follow this path.

The BBC has to appear neutral. It also has to be relevant. There is more
media noise than ever before, and there may be a desire to work in their
own "clickbait" media. But it is their public status that makes their
purpose as the perceived eye of the storm.

They should not abandon or abuse this purpose.

Even given that conflict of purpose that the BBC is under, it published
that article. An article that is divisive and yet, not about being
neutral or relevant. It has no value.

It's narrative suggests that its subject is controversial, but it isn't.

I support equality, but you won't typically see me fighting tooth and
nail for first world women's rights, especially as men's rights are in
my opinion, not given full credibility. But this case is clear cut:

1.  In most other shows, there are more male roles than female roles as
    actors.
2.  There are more female actors than male actors, which makes it harder
    for female actors to find roles.
3.  There is no real need to have more male roles than female roles in
    contemporary dramas.

I'd also suggest (without proof) that the available female actors are
likely better qualified than the available male actors. We probably
should be encouraging writers of contemporary dramas to have more female
roles. At the very least, we shouldn't be undermining the writers who
do.

The BBC is manufacturing an empty, useless debate. When there aren't any
stories, you shouldn't publish any.
