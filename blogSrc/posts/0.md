# I blame Google Chrome

It's a browser.

It's pretty good, I suppose. Aside from missing very few features, and
covering the spec, it has great developer tools. It also the only
browser that you can easily get on most popular devices today... by the
virtue of having a monopoly on Chrome OS. Still, it is largely a good
custodian of progressing the web and it's responsibilities. \[Enter
cheap joke about Microsoft here\]

It is still just about the quickest browser too, as of right now...
***Wait a second...*** Why is my computer lagging? I've only got Atom
and Chrome open.

![Chrome using 2.5GB of RAM](images/monitor_chrome.jpg)

**UN. I. DEAL.** My RAM is getting wrecked. Chrome's using 2.5GB,
Slack's using 1.5GB and Atom's using 3GB.

That's 7GB. For 3 programs. I mean, technically you can make [web
browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers#Text-based),
[Slack clients](https://github.com/erroneousboat/slack-term) and [text
editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors#Text_user_interface)
that work in the terminal. And yet, these three apps need 7GB between
them?

```none
1969 Apollo 11 Memory:
  AGC Total RAM:
    1 kiloword = 1,024 * word = 1,024 * 16 bits = 16,384 bits.

2018 Slack Memory:
  Slack Approx RAM Usage:
    1.5GB = 1,500,000,000 bytes = 1,500,000,000 * 8 bits = 12,000,000,000 bits.

Number of spaceships needed to run Slack's desktop app:
  ceil(12,000,000,000 / 16,384) = 732,422 spaceships
```

# Electron

Why does Slack use all this RAM? Well, it runs on [Electron](), which is
a Chrome window with some native system access, similar in concept to
Apache Cordova. The benefit for Slack is that it can be written once to
work on Windows, Mac and Linux. It also means reduced platform-specific
bugs, easier and more maintainable development.
[D.R.Y.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) af.

However, it has 2 main problems.

1.  It uses a lot of memory as Chrome uses a lot of memory.
2.  It has a slow startup time.

The random delays while it tries to find some memory, and the startup
time are frankly, really annoying.

# Atom also uses Electron

I visited Github's office in San Francisco in 2017 and was surprised to
learn that the Atom only had 4 developers. Which speaks to their immense
talent and also the developer-friendliness of Electron (which Github is
also behind).

But running a web browser in the background is, surely, overkill. Lots
of web developer tools use Electron as you need only be a web developer
to make them. They include:

  - Atom
  - Visual Studio Code
  - Hyper (Terminal)
  - Postman (for HTTP requests)
  - MongoDB Compass
  - [many more...](https://electronjs.org/apps)

# Atom is slow at basic text-editor things

The following numbers are from [this Github
repo](https://github.com/jhallen/joes-sandbox/tree/master/editor-perf).
There are more tests and results on that page.

## File 1:

```c

\*Atom won't highlight large files by default.

# Wow. Sublime is fast.

Who knew? It can even open a 3GB file.

Not even command line editors `emacs`, `vim` or even `nano` could open
it, yet Sublime managed it in a not completely unreasonable 75 seconds,
and even has a cute progress bar.

# Isn't Sublime the one with the please buy me popup?

Yes. But you could actually buy it. I think we're programmed to ignore
that popup from the WinRAR era... ðŸ˜‚

It costs $80. For that, you get **no more popups**, get **access to the
latest developer builds**, and the option to **suggest new features**.
It is a **buy once, keep forever** deal. Indeed, they may seek to follow
the emerging trend of charging on a recurring basis in the future so
buying it now might not be the worst idea.

The worst thing about Sublime is it's appearance, but that's easily
remediable.

I use the delightful "Monokai Pro" theme and color scheme, check it out
[here](https://www.monokai.pro/). It has been getting a lot of jealous
looks from my Atom-equipped colleagues. It's only 10 euros, though of
course 10 euros more that most available themes.

Otherwise the best options seem to be:

# Sublime isn't quite perfect

  - You can't do basic file renaming, deleting and moving in the
    tree-view without the extension
    [SideBarEnhancements](https://github.com/SideBarEnhancements-org/SideBarEnhancements)
  - Atom and VS Code work much nicer with version control, like Git
    ([Sublime Suggestion
    Thread](https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/api-suggestions/20640/26#post_26))
  - If you don't like something, you can't just hack away at it like you
    can in Atom
  - The find and replace through multiple files is weird, the results
    screen is a bit dated and finding the

But the speed advantage really does make up for a lot, and
(subjectively) improves coding focus.

There really aren't many multi-platform alternatives to Electron-based
editors besides Sublime Text, but one with a lot of promise is xi-editor
(<https://github.com/google/xi-editor>), which I am very excited about.
It's relatively early stages and it takes quite a bit of setting up, but
it *could* end up being very, very good. Fingers crossed.
