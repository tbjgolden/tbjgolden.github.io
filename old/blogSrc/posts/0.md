# But first, Google Chrome

It is still just about the quickest browser too, as of right now...

**_Wait a second..._** Why is my computer lagging? I've only got Atom and Chrome
open.

![Chrome using 2.5GB of RAM](images/monitor_chrome.jpg)

**UN. I. DEAL.** My RAM is getting wrecked. Chrome's using 2.5GB, Slack's using
1.5GB and Atom's using 3GB.

That's 7GB. For 3 programs. I mean, technically you can make
[web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers#Text-based),
[Slack clients](https://github.com/erroneousboat/slack-term) and
[text editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors#Text_user_interface)
that work in the terminal. And yet, these three apps need 7GB between them?

```none
1969 Apollo 11 Memory:
  AGC Total RAM:
    1 kiloword = 1,024 * word = 1,024 * 16 bits = 16,384 bits.

2018 Slack Memory:
  Slack Approx RAM Usage:
    1.5GB = 1,500,000,000 bytes = 1,500,000,000 * 8 bits = 12,000,000,000 bits.

Number of spaceships needed to run Slack's desktop app:
  ceil(12,000,000,000 / 16,384) = 732,422 spaceships
```

# Electron

I guess I can understand why Chrome uses all this RAM, but why do Slack or Atom
need that much?

Both Atom and Slack's desktop app are built with
[Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), made by the folks at Github.

Electron is a Chrome window with some native system access, similar in concept
to Apache Cordova. That means that a project uses a single code source and then
can work on Windows, Mac and Linux. Ergo less platform-specific bugs and faster
development. [D.R.Y.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) af.

However, it has 2 main problems.

1. It uses a lot of memory, as Chrome uses a lot of memory.
2. It has a slow startup time, as Chrome has a slow startup time.

The random delays while it tries to find some memory, and the startup time often
stop me from using them for quick tasks.

When I visited Github's office in San Francisco in 2017, I was surprised to
learn that the Atom team (Atom is also made by Github) was only 4 developers.

Running a web browser to run a text editor is surely overkill.

It's not just Atom either. Many web developer tools use Electron as you need
only be a web developer to make them. They include:

- Atom
- Visual Studio Code
- Hyper (Terminal)
- Postman (for HTTP requests)
- MongoDB Compass
- [many more...](https://electronjs.org/apps)

# Atom is slow at basic text-editor things

The following numbers are from
[this Github repo](https://github.com/jhallen/joes-sandbox/tree/master/editor-perf).
There are more tests and results on that page.

## File 1:

`hello.c`

```c
include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

|  Editor   | RAM used (kB) |

|  _atom_   |     `250,404` |
| _vscode_  |     `339,512` |

## File 2:

`test.xml` (5.8MB XML File)

|  Editor   | RAM used (kB) | RAM used (no highlighting) (kB) |
| :-------: | ------------: | ------------------------------: |
|    vim    |      `11,952` |                        `11,824` |

| _sublime_ |                `5s` |
| emacs -nw |                `8s` |
|    vim    |               `10s` |
| _vscode_  |               `28s` |
|  _atom_   |            `1m 22s` |

|  Editor   | Find and replace time |
| :-------: | --------------------: |
|    vim    |                `4.6s` |
| _sublime_ |                  `6s` |
| emacs -nw |                `9.7s` |
| _vscode_  |              `1m 12s` |
|  _atom_   |            `over 10m` |

\*Atom won't highlight large files by default.

# Wow. Sublime is fast.

Who knew? It can even open a 3GB file.

Not even command line editors `emacs`, `vim` or even `nano` could open it, yet
Sublime managed it in a not completely unreasonable 75 seconds, and even has a
cute progress bar. Awwh.

# Isn't Sublime the one with the please buy me popup?

Yes. But you could actually buy it. I think we're programmed to ignore that
popup from the WinRAR era...

It costs \$80. For that, you get **no more popups**, get **access to the latest
developer builds**, and the option to **suggest new features**.

Personally, \$80 to make you a more efficient developer for years is a price
worth paying, and helps to guarantee some level of product support.

# ...but Sublime Text is ugly...

True... but that's just the default theme.

I'm using the delightful "Monokai Pro" theme and color scheme (check it out
[here](https://www.monokai.pro/)) and it has been getting a lot of jealous looks
from my Atom-equipped colleagues. It's 10 EUR.

Other options include:

# Sublime isn't quite perfect

- You can't do basic file renaming, deleting and moving in the tree-view without
  the extension
  [SideBarEnhancements](https://github.com/SideBarEnhancements-org/SideBarEnhancements)
- ~~Atom and VS Code work much nicer with version control, like Git~~  
  (Update 2019) It's got it now :D
- If you don't like something, you can't just hack some JS & CSS together like
  you can in Atom
- Sublime's documentation is very not good
- The directory recursive find and replace is either very restrictive with how
  to find the files with glob search, and the results screen is basic

The find and replace UI definitely needs work &ndash; but it is a lot faster
than other editors, and in front-end, where languages are often not friendly to
IDE functionality, find and replace is typically the most effective way of
finding where something is coming from.

There really aren't many multi-platform GUI alternatives to Electron-based
editors besides Sublime Text, but one that may end up veing popular
[xi-editor](https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor), which is open-source and
written in Rust ðŸ˜„
