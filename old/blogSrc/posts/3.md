(Open publication of my formal complaint to BBC News)

**tl;dr**

1. the BBC published a pointless article designed to trigger
2. got triggered
3. wrote triggered message designed to trigger

---

The article they posted that caused me to write a complaint was this one:

**Bodyguard 'airbrushing reality' with powerful women portrayal**  
<https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45803343>

> If I'm a male actor, I'm annoyed at the repeated emphasis on this topic.
>
> If I'm a female actor, I'm annoyed as in a field where there are more male
> roles than female roles and more female actors than male actors, my chances
> aren't being helped.
>
> If I'm a woman, I'm seeing our attempt at equality be pushed back in a field
> where it quite obviously is unfair.
>
> If I'm a man, I'm confused as to why I'm asked to support affirmative action
> towards improving women's career opportunities then watch it be undermined.
>
> If I'm a cynic, I might imagine the BBC just wants to draw attention to its
> own series through the medium of biased journalism on a non-story.
>
> I could go on for quite a while with this "If I'm X" stuff, which makes me
> wonder... who is this article for? The only person who might find this article
> interesting is a young girl who probably doesn't need reminding or even to
> know in the first place that the odds haven't always been with them. It has
> been long suggested on the BBC and other media that making people aware that
> they're not supposed to succeed at something doesn't, on mass, help them.
